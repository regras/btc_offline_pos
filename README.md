# btc_offline_pos
This is a End of Course Work developed by student David Mao San Wei and professor supervisor Marco Aur√©lio Amaral Henrique. This is a implementation for a Bitcoin point of sales system that works offline. There is also a report about this terminal written in portuguese in the same directory. In addition you can access my video that explain how this terminal works with demonstration in portuguese by [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/moqMJZM8ooc)

There are two sub-directories in this project:

### terminal_de_baixo_custo
This directory contains the server side code for the terminal.

### android_wallet
This one contains a android wallet for Bitcoin transaction, I did some small modifications from the [Original Project](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet)
To compile the wallet software, you need install [Android IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). You may also download proper android sdk and ndk. For Android Emulator, you could use the build-in one or just use [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/). The only modification that I made in this wallet is located in **/android-wallet/wallet/src/de/schildbach/wallet/ui/send/SendCoinsFragment.java**.
