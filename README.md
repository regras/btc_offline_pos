# btc_offline_pos
This is a End of Course Work developed by student David Mao San Wei and professor supervisor Marco Aurélio Amaral Henrique. This is a implementation for a Bitcoin point of sales system that works offline. There is also a [report](relatório_final_tfc_david.pdf) about this terminal written in portuguese in the same directory. In addition you can access my video that explain how this terminal works with demonstration in portuguese by [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/moqMJZM8ooc)

There are two sub-directories in this project:

### terminal_de_baixo_custo
This directory contains the server side code for the terminal.

### android_wallet
This one contains a android wallet for Bitcoin transaction, I did some small modifications from the [Original Project](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet)
